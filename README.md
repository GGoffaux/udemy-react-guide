# Personal achievements in Javascript, REACT (and more)

This document lists mini-projects related to REACT programming as well as other Javascript courses. The programming course in REACT is from UDEMY : REACT - THe Complete Guide by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. 

The mini-projets are : 

- [The Food App](https://ggoffaux.github.io/udemy-react-guide/The_Food_Order_App/build) : a list of food items and a cart to shop.
- [The Expense Tracker](https://ggoffaux.github.io/udemy-react-guide/The_Expense_Tracker/build) : a mini-app to list your expense.
- [Meetups](https://udemy-react-guide-delta.vercel.app/): made with Next.js to list and create meetups. 

In addition, these are two mini-projects done in the context of Coursera courses.

- [David Chu’s China Bistro](https://ggoffaux.github.io/COURSERA_HTML_CSS_JS_EXERCISES/module5-solution/index.html) : from « HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT for web developers »
- [Ristorante con Fusion](https://ggoffaux.github.io/COURSERA_BOOTSTRAP4_conFusion/conFusion/index.html) : from Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4

Finally, this is personal project using Bootstrap that I initiated.
